## File Organizer


This project introduces a file organizer script written in Python. The script, using the pathlib module, categorizes files in a specified directory into folders based on their extensions. The main function, organisateur_fichiers, ensures the creation of destination folders and efficiently relocates files. To cater to different proficiency levels, a beginner-friendly version is also provided, emphasizing simplicity for those new to Python.

### Usage Instructions:

1. Install Python:

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the Script:

4. Check Organized Folders:
